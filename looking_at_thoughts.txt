[quote]What colour do you see when looking at GREEN ?
This is a very clear and simple experience. Just LOOKING and SEEING a colour. That is all.
All the rest is just thinking about the experience.
We are not interested in that.[/quote]







[quote]Is 'green' associated in any way with the experience of the colour red?
Why not ' I SEE no association'?
Do you SEE the difference?[/quote]







[quote]Now, can you physically grasp that image of a cup? Can you pour tea into it?
Can you drink from it?
Is there a ‘real’ cup or just an image of a cup?
Is there an appearing mental image?
Is the content of the mental image (the cup) ‘real’?[/quote]






[quote]The thoughts and mental images are real only as arising thoughts and mental images, their ‘presence’ cannot be denied. However their contents, what are they about are not ‘real’, they are just fantasies.
Can you see this?[/quote]






[quote]Over the course of the next day or so, I'd like you to notice the content of thoughts. Whenever there is an arising thought or mental image, check whether its content (what it’s about) is really happening, or the content is just pure imagination. Let me know how it goes.[/quote]

Noticing thoughts about completing this exercise; they are not real, they are just thoughts. I can feel the hands moving, touching the keyboard. At first, the thoughts about this activity had the content of 'being the same thing' as the activity itself, but I can SEE they are two things. There is the life of the mind, there is the life of the hands and everything else.






[quote]Is 'initiated' a Direct Experience?
Or a thought or label, an image?
Does it exist at all?
Can you SEE it or SENSE it?
Or total fantasy?
What does exist is LOOKING, NOTICING, SEEING.[/quote]
